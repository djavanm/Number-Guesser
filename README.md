### Number Guesser Doubles

This web app allows two users to create a hidden random number. The users can then submit guesses until they reach the hidden number together. This game was built using CSS+Flexbox, JavaScript, and HTML. 

## Project Overview:
Number Guesser was my first foray into a JavaScript web app. I learned how to manipulate the DOM by adding new elements, adjusting values of the page, and using CSS to adjust the page based on the users screen size. 

# Overall Wins: 
I feel most proud about the functionality I was able to add to the game. I was able to complete the project with only one anonymous function. Learning how to use JavaScript to validate inputs and ensure a good user experience was also very satisfying. 

# Overall Struggles:
Learning how to create CSS has still been a struggle for me. The site itself was not very complicated in terms of styling, but I think I will need to dedicate more time within a project to properly styling my objects and ensuring they closely represent what the comp is looking for. 

# Game Overview:

The game automatically loads a random number between 1 and 100. Two users can use the update button to generate a new random number. You may then enter a name, and a guess number inside the range given. Each guess is then tallied, and the page will display a hint to tell them where the winning number lies in relation to their guess. You can continue guessing until you find the correct random number. 

Once the winning number is correctly guessed, the page will display the winner, as well as how many guesses they needed to find the number. Users can click the 'x' within the winner card to remove it from the page.
